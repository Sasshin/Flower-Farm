# You should generate a requirements.txt file with all your dependencies listed on it and put that in your git.
# "requirements.txt" is the Python convention for naming your dependencies file).
# Then when someone wants to recreate your exact venv environment, they can do so from using "pip install -r requirements.txt"


# With your venv activated, run this in the terminal:

# pip freeze > requirements.txt

# The resulting file outputs a list of all your project's dependencies and allows another user (or you) to set up your project quickly on another #computer.

# The user just needs to clone the repository on another computer, create a venv and then run pip install -r 'requirements.txt' and it will install all #the dependencies for the cloned repository.
